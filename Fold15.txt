Maybe, it's too late or, maybe, early,
It has not occurred to me for years,
I resemble now Don Juan, really,
Like a proper flippant man of verse.

What's the matter? What has happened, really?
Every day I have some other chick.
And I lose self-pity, willy-nilly,
And defy unfaithfulness and trick.

Hold me back, restrain me, scornful feeling,
I have always been marked up by you.
In my heart I have a chilly
And the rustle of lilac of blue.

In my heart I have a lemon sunset,
Through the fog I hear  someone say:
For your freedom you will have to answer,
Well, Don Juan, take the challenge, eh?
